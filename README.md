# Description

Binder is a genome-guided transcriptome assembler that is specifically designed to integrate assemblers of different transcriptom assemblers(such as Bridger and Scallop2) to build the merge splice graph and to extract more reliable paired paths. Binder employs a dynamic programming algorithm to recover the transcripts by making strategic use of the label-information. The software has been developed to be user-friendly.

The software takes a file that lists GTF format files generated by different transcriptom assemblers and BAM file as input, and outputs all assembled candidate transcripts in GTF format.

This software is free to use, modify, redistribute without any restrictions, except including the license provided with the distribution.

** Note **

The current version of Binder can accepts BAM files generated by one De Nove transcriptome assembler and one Genome Guided transcriptome assembler, if takes more trancripts from more than two assemblers at present, the result maybe not perfect.
